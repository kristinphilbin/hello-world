Creating data visualisation for the communications world.

Hi everyone - a little over a year ago I started my own consulting firm to create a more reliable, scalable way to measure impact within the communications industry.  With a growing client base, I have expanded my offerings and am creating new opportunities for my agency partners and clients alike.  I think good measurement is clean, simple and easy for anyone to understand.
